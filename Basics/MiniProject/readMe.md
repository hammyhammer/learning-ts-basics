This folder and the content it has will have the quick setup process steps.

1) tsc --init in the terminal. This will give us the ts config file. 
2) Make a folder called dist and src. (Src will be our main stuff, dist is the JS file.)
3) make an index ts file in our src. 
4) go ts config file. change outDir: to "outDir": "./dist"
